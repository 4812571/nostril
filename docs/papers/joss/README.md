==========

To generate a local preview of the paper, you will first need to clone a copy of the [Whedon](https://github.com/openjournals/whedon) repository into the current directory.  Then, you can `make` in the current directory.

More explicitly:

```
git clone https://github.com/openjournals/whedon
make
```
