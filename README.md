‚òÄ Introduction
-----------------------------

_Nostril_ is a Python 3 module that can be used to infer whether a given word or text string is likely to be nonsense or meaningful text.  Nostril takes a text string and returns `True` if it is probably nonsense, `False` otherwise (if it likely to be meaningful).  In the context of CASICS, the main use case is to decide whether strings returned by source code mining methods are likely to be (e.g.) program identifiers, or random characters or other non-identifier strings.

The approach implemented in Nostril uses [n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) coupled with a custom [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf‚Äìidf) weighting scheme.  It is reasonably fast: once the module is loaded, on a 4 Ghz Apple OS X 10.12 computer, calling the evaluation function returns a result in 20-30 microseconds on average.

‚ñ∫ Using Nostril
---------------

The basic usage is very simple.  Nostril provides (among other things) a function named `is_nonsense()`.  This function takes a text string as an argument and returns a Boolean value as a result.  Here is an example:

```python
from nostril import is_nonsense
result = is_nonsense('yoursinglestringhere')
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
--------------

Nostril is not fool-proof; **it _will_ generate some false positive and false negatives**.  This is an unavoidable consequence of the problem domain: without direct knowledge, even a human cannot recognize a real text string in all cases.  Nostril's default trained system puts emphasis on reducing false positives (i.e., reducing how often it mistakenly labels something as nonsense) rather than false negatives, so it will sometimes report that something is not nonsense when it really is.  With its default parameter values, on dictionary words (specifically, 218,752 words from `/usr/share/dict/web2`), the default version of `is_nonsense()` achieves greater than 99.99% accuracy.  In tests on real identifiers extracted from actual software source code, it achieves 99.94% to 99.96% accuracy; on truly random strings, it achieves 86% accuracy.  Inspecting the errors shows that most false positives really are quite ambiguous, to the point where most false positives are random-looking, and many false negatives could be plausible identifiers.

A vexing result is that this system does more poorly on "random" strings typed by a human.  In a data set of 1000 strings "typed at random" by the author, it achieves only 67% accuracy.  I hypothesize this is because those strings may be less random than they seem: if someone is asked to type junk at random on a QWERTY keyboard, they are likely to use a lot of characters from the home row (a-s-d-f-g-h-j-k-l), and those actually turn out to be rather common in English words.  In other words, what we think of a strings "typed at random" on a keyboard are actually not that random, and probably have statistical properties similar to those of real words.  These cases are hard for Nostril, but thankfully, in real-world situations, they are rare.  This view is supported by the fact that Nostril's performance is much better on statistically random text strings generated by software.

Finally, the algorithm does not perform well on very short text, and by default, Nostril imposes a lower length limit of 6 characters &ndash; strings have to be longer than 6 characters or else it will raise an exception.
