<dt>`common-stop-words.txt`</dt>
<dd>
A selected set of stop words from the English language.  Generated by looking at the stop words in NLTK's `nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')` and selecting a subset that the authors feel are reasonably commonly used in programming contexts.
</dd>

<dt>`other-words.txt`</dt>
<dd>
A list of words that don't seem to appear in the corpuses above.  This includes a sample of Roman numerals, plus some words that appear in dictionaries and get flagged as false positives by the nonsense detector.  Obviously, it would be better to avoid having a special list of words like this, but in the interest of saving time, this is what I did.
