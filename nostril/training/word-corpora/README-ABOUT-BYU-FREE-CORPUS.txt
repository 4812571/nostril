The 5000 word list here came from http://www.wordfrequency.info.
Downloaded on 2016-11-22 (link at http://www.wordfrequency.info/free.asp)

Here are the terms of use:

  1. Please do not post material from this frequency list on other websites
  without clearly identifying the source (http://www.wordfrequency.info), and
  creating a link from that site to this. There is unique information in this
  list that identifies you as the owner of this list (mhucka@gmail.com). A
  Google query will run every night to search for copies of this file on the
  Web.  If it is found and there is no link to this site, you will be
  identified as the owner and you will be asked to either create the link
  immediately or to remove the list from the web. Thanks for your
  understanding.

  2. You can copy and paste this table into Excel and then re-sort by word
  (alphabetical) or part of speech.

  3. The rank order is a function of both frequency and "dispersion", which
  measures how evenly the word is spread across the corpus (1 = most evenly
  distributed; 0 = appears irregularly in few texts).

  4. The free list contains just the bare list of the top 5,000 words in
  American English. It is also possible to download other lists that contain
  the top 20-30 collocates (nearby words) for each of these words -- which
  provides useful information on word meaning and usage -- as well as to see
  which words are most common in certain genres (e.g. spoken or academic). It
  is also possible to download highly accurate lists for the top 10,000, the
  top 20,000 words, and the top 60,000 words  in English, with their top
  collocates as well.

  5. Part of speech codes can be found at
  http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws7tags.html.

  6. If you want a printed version of the list with collocates, genre
  information, etc, you might consider the book Frequency Dictionary of
  American English: word sketches, collocates, and thematic lists (Routledge,
  2010).
